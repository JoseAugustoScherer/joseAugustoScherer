## Hi there 👋, my name is José Augusto Scherer!

## 👤 About Me
I’m a huge fan of Node.js, Java, and writing testable, maintainable code.
When I’m not in front of my computer—learning something new or building small applications for fun—you’ll probably find me playing games 🎮, reading 📖, riding my motorcycle 🏍️, playing guitar 🎸 or lifting weights 💪.

## 💻 What I’m Working On
I’m currently working on personal projects to keep my skills sharp 🔪 and consolidate the knowledge I acquire along the way.

You can check out some of these projects in my pinned 📌 repositories.
